here we're going to examine the concept of innovation

what is it that determines a societies innovation?

what reflects it?

----------------

literature to be drawn upon will include: small is beautiful, even if you don't want to credit it.

possibly the haltiwanger business formation research

cite at least 3 sources.

-------------------

datasets and streams of research to reflect:

- ease of doing business

- capital inflows

- aid flows

- business formation, and possibly job formation

- distribution of workforce and economy by sector (don't do pie - opt for newer vizzes)

remember to always scale by population

-----------------------


feel free to run a few regressions where appropriate. 

to determine target variables.

but the focus should be on 80% descriptive statistics, 20% inferential, where appropriate. 

correlation and cross tabs counts too.


-----------------------

lastly, end with a narrative, a future projection of growth. 

trends. and contexts - where appropriate. 

also select a timeframe, and define the scope of your study appropriately.

-----------------------

let this be a long form piece - 1000 words, written by saturday.

and structure it like a paper
